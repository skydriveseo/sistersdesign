					<h1>American Flag Bikini For Women - These Rock!</h1>
<!--contentstart-->
					<p>Let freedom ring is one of the most notorious chants from the American people during the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, which is Independence Day. It was the day that USA freed itself from the oppressive taxation without representation. With this came a long celebrated love for all that the USA accomplished to win its independence. The flag is waved and American Flag shirts, bathing suits, women&rsquo;s bikinis, hoodies, beach cover ups and red white and blue stars and stripes tumblers carry over the beach. As dawn hits the fireworks push up into the sky where there burst into the air are to remind the American People what is was like for Frances Scott Key to write the famous line in the Star Spangled Banner &ldquo;And The Bombs Burst Into Air&rdquo; which is sung by so many that felt the sting of all the wars to come. Many families had fathers, grand fathers and great grand fathers that fought in these wars. Some did not come home. Some came home physically disrupted and some came home mentally a fraction of what they were when they went in&hellip;.and that is why Freedom is not Free.</p>

					<amp-img src="https://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server2300/c8a82/products/1774/images/6022/ruffin-flag-american-flag-string-bikini__31620.1518628263.1280.1280.jpg?c=2" alt="Hampers Christmas" height="270" width="290"></amp-img>
					</div>
					
					<p>So ever year on the 4<sup>th</sup> of the July when the American people dawn their stars and stripes, wear their <a href="https://www.southernsistersdesigns.com/usa-flag-clothing/">American flag Shirts</a>, shoot of their fireworks they don&rsquo;t just do their for their appreciation of what this country has to offer. They do it for those that have paid so many different prices to win freedoms and keep this country free. So many take for granted these freedoms but many do not. So this year when the 4<sup>th</sup> of july comes around put on your best red, white and blue bikini. Pull out that stars and stripes dress ladies and men muscle up with your patriotic tank tops. It is to show your appreciation for those that had to wear their uniforms and fight so that all of us can have the freedom whether they appreciate it or not. And also to be able to keep these freedoms whether they are appreciate it or not.</p>

					<amp-img src="https://cdn1.bigcommerce.com/server2300/c8a82/products/1774/images/1751/american_flag_bikini_13__43348.1518628160.1280.1280.jpg?c=2" alt="Hampers Christmas Today" height="390" width="340"></amp-img>

					<p>It was one of the hardest things that the soldiers face. They come home to many people that see no value in what they are doing. They use words that are like knives but still use the freedoms afforded by those very soldiers. To be unappreciated is not bad enough. You are often called many names and harassed. But a soldier doesn&rsquo;t do what they do for those people to say the right thing. They do what they do so that All Americans, no matter their race, no matter their religion, no matter the hate in their hearts, they are all Americans and that is why the soldier does what he does. So this year I will wear my patriotic shirts, <a href="https://www.southernsistersdesigns.com/american-flag-string-bikini-top-and-bottom/">American Flag Bikini</a>, Pants, Put on the Red White and Blue dress and march around proud to be An American. I will be proud to stand up for those that stand up for me. I will be proud to stand up for those that can&rsquo;t see and appreciate what millions around the world would kill or die for. Sadly that is what it means to be a soldier. Hero? Most will tell you no&hellip;until their very freedoms are challenged. These are the same people that are afraid to go to other countries an travel abroad yet feel safe at home. Thanks to all the soldiers that fight for those that are too ignorant to thank them for the freedoms afforded.</p>
